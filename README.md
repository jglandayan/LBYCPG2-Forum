**Getting Started**

In order to be able to run this forum application properly, the following steps must be done:

	1. Click the link of the project's Github repository.
  
	2. Download the ZIP file of the project repository by clicking on the green button entitled 'Code' and then choosing the 'Download ZIP' option.
  
	3. Once the ZIP file has been downloaded, extract the 'LBYCPG2-Forum-main' folder found in the ZIP file into your User directory (e.g. C:\Users\MSI GV62 7RD)
  
	4. Open the Anaconda Prompt Program.
  
	5. Once the Anaconda Prompt has been opened, enter the command "cd LBYCPG2-Forum-main". The directory used by the program should now be the LBYCPG2-Forum-main".
  
	6. Type in the command "pip install -r requirements.txt". This should allow for the Anaconda Prompt to automatically install the necessary packages that are required for this application.
  
	7. Once the packages have been successfully installed into your machine, we are now ready to run the application. Do this by typing in the command "manage.py runserver" into Anaconda Prompt.
